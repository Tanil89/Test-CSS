<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Hello friend, welcome to my website! 
I've been roleplaying for more than 17 years, since I was 16 years old. I decided to share my roleplaying experiences with others while I'm learning a little html :)</p>
<p>So in this blog you will find my characters, with their backgrounds, and their sessions told from their point of view. <br>
I may tell my sessions as a gamemaster, in which case I will tell those without any POV.</p> 
<p>If I have enough time, I may add my other RP experiences.</p>
<p>I suggest using the default site theme, as I could select a specific theme for each character, however you are free to select the one you prefer</p>
<h1>What about me</h1>
<p>I started roleplaying with friends from school. I remember we started with DnD 4e. Even though we didn't appreciate the system, maybe our inexperience didn't help; none of us had ever played before, but it was a nice experience.</p>
<p>Since then, I've tried a lot of systems: Sine Requie, Dark Heresy, free form, Warhammer fantasy, several systems with additional homerules, Fabula Ultima etc.</p>
<p>I've also played some LARP (Live Action RolePlay), sometimes as a player, sometimes as an NPC. Honestly, I prefer the NPC role, you can change a lot of characters. <br>
I am currently working on a LARP project as a contributor, mainly following the event as a referee, with a focus on combat safety and enemy management</p>
